# RendDr

At this point i am relative new to C and to programming in general. This project should be a playground for me to discover C and improve my coding skills. 

RendDr "renderer" should be a small terminal ASCII raytrace attempt but now i found myself design a GUI and reusable menu. So i dont know where the project lands.

As mentioned I use the project for learning purpose so i add features on the fly and look how everything works together
