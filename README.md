RendDr is a fun side project I started to practice C and learn more about how things work under the hood. The goal is to build an ASCII renderer — basically a way to "draw" using characters in the terminal.

Right now, it’s just a playground where I experiment and add features as I go. I’m also thinking bout adding support for rendering to image formats in the future.

All is written in C cause i want to improve my C skills
